V0.3.2
------

This is release version ``0.3.2`` of Nuclei SDK.

* Build

    - **Important changes** about build system:

      - The SoC and RTOS related makefiles are moving to its own folder, and controlled By
        **build.mk** inside in in the SoC/<SOC> or OS/<RTOS> folders.
      - Middlware component build system is also available now, you can add you own middleware or library
        into ``Components`` folder, such as ``Components/tjpgd`` or ``Components/fatfs``, and you can include
        this component using make variable ``MIDDLEWARE`` in application Makefile, such as ``MIDDLEWARE := fatfs``,
        or ``MIDDLEWARE := tjpgd fatfs``.
      - Each middleware component folder should create a ``build.mk``, which is used to control
        the component build settings and source code management.
      - An extra ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` macro is passed to represent the DOWNLOAD mode string.
      - In ``startup_<Device>.S`` now, we don't use ``DOWNLOAD_MODE`` to handle the vector table location, instead
        we defined a new macro called ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` to stand for whether the vector table's vma != lma.
        If ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` is defined, the vector table is placed in ``.vtable_ilm``, which means the vector
        table is placed in flash and copy to ilm when startup.
    - Change openocd ``--pipe`` option to ``-c "gdb_port pipe; log_output openocd.log"``
    - Remove ``-ex "monitor flash protect 0 0 last off"`` when upload or debug program to avoid error
      when openocd configuration file didn't configure a flash
    - Add ``cleanall`` target in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Makefile**, you can clean all the applications
      defined by ``EXTRA_APP_ROOTDIRS`` variable
    - Fix ``size`` target of build system

* Tools

    - Add ``nsdk_cli`` tools in Nuclei SDK which support run applications

      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/requirements.txt**: python module requirement file
      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/configs**: sample configurations used by scripts below
      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/nsdk_bench.py**: nsdk bench runner script
      - **tools/scripts/nsdk_cli/nsdk_execute.py**: nsdk execute runner script

* SoC

    - Add general bit operations and memory access APIs in ``<Device>.h``, eg. ``_REG32(p, i)``, ``FLIP_BIT(regval, bitofs)``
    - ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_xxx`` macros are now placed in ``<Device>.h``, which is removed from ``riscv_encoding.h``, user can define
      different ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_xxx`` according to its device/board settings.
    - ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` are now used to show the download mode string, which should be passed eg. ``-DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING=\"flash\"``,
      it is used in ``system_<Device>.c``
    - ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_xxx`` now is used in ``startup_<Device>.S`` to control the vector table location,
      instead a new macro called ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` is used, and it should be defined in ``SoC/<SOC>/build.mk``
      if the vector table's LMA and VMA are different.

* NMSIS

    - Bump NMSIS to version 1.0.2

* OS

    - Fix OS task switch bug in RT-Thread

    - The ``hbird`` SoC is renamed to ``demosoc``, so the ``SoC/hbird`` folder is renamed to ``SoC/demosoc``,
      and the ``SoC/hbird/Board/hbird_eval`` is renamed to ``SoC/demosoc/Board/nuclei_fpga_eval``.

* SoC

      - Please use ``SOC=demosoc BOARD=nuclei_fpga_eval`` to replace ``SOC=hbird BOARD=hbird_eval``
      - The changes are done to not using the name already used in opensource Hummingbird E203 SoC.
