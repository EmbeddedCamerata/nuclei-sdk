.. _develop_buildsystem:

Build System based on Makefile
==============================

Nuclei SDK's build system is based on Makefile, user can build,
run ordebug application in Windows and Linux.

.. _develop_buildsystem_structure:

Makefile Structure
------------------

Nuclei SDK's Makefiles mainly placed in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Build** directory and
an extra *Makefile* located in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Makefile**.

This extra **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Makefile** introduce a new Make variable called
**PROGRAM** to provide the ability to build or run application in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>**.

For example, if you want to *rebuild and upload* application **application/baremetal/timer_test**,
you can run ``make PROGRAM=application/baremetal/timer_test clean upload`` to achieve it.


The **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Build** directory content list as below:

.. code-block:: text

    gmsl/
    Makefile.base
    Makefile.conf
    Makefile.core
    Makefile.components
    Makefile.files
    Makefile.global  -> Created by user
    Makefile.misc
    Makefile.rtos
    Makefile.rules
    Makefile.soc

The file or directory is used explained as below:

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_base:

Makefile.base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.base** file is used as Nuclei SDK build system entry file,
application's Makefile need to include this file to use all the features of
Nuclei SDK build system.

It will expose Make variables or options such as **BOARD** or **SOC** passed
by ``make`` command, click :ref:`develop_buildsystem_exposed_make_vars`
to learn more.

This file will include optional :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_global`
and :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_local` which allow user to set custom
global Makefile configurations and local application Makefile configurations.

This file will include the following makefiles:

* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_gmsl`: additional library functions provided via gmsl
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_misc`: misc functions and OS check helpers
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_conf`: main Makefile configuration entry
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_rules`: make rules of this build system

.. _develop_buildsystem_gmsl:

gmsl
~~~~

The **gmsl** directory consist of the `GNU Make Standard Library (GMSL)`_,
which is an a library of functions to be used with GNU Make's $(call) that
provides functionality not available in standard GNU Make.

We use this **gmsl** tool to make sure we help us achieve some linux command
which is only supported in Linux.

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_misc:

Makefile.misc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.misc** file mainly provide these functions:

* Define **get_csrcs**, **get_asmsrcs**, **get_cxxsrcs** and **check_item_exist** make functions

  - **get_csrcs**: Function to get ``*.c or *.C`` source files from a list of directories, no ability to
    do recursive match. e.g. ``$(call get_csrcs, csrc csrc/abc)`` will return c source files in
    ``csrc`` and ``csrc/abc`` directories.
  - **get_asmsrcs**: Function to get ``*.s or *.S`` source files from a list of directories, no ability to
    do recursive match. e.g. ``$(call get_asmsrcs, asmsrc asmsrc/abc)`` will return asm source files in
    ``asmsrc`` and ``asmsrc/abc`` directories.
  - **get_cxxsrcs**: Function to get ``*.cpp or *.CPP`` source files from a list of directories, no ability
    to do recursive match. e.g. ``$(call get_cxxsrcs, cppsrc cppsrc/abc)`` will return cpp source files in
    ``cppsrc`` and ``cppsrc/abc`` directories.
  - **check_item_exist**: Function to check if item existed in a set of items. e.g.
    ``$(call check_item_exist, flash, flash ilm flashxip)`` will check ``flash`` whether existed in
    ``flash ilm flashxip``, if existed, return ``flash``, otherwise return empty.

* Check and define OS related functions, and also a set of trace print functions.

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_conf:

Makefile.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.conf** file will define the following items:

* Toolchain related variables used during compiling
* Debug related variables
* Include :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_files` and :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_rtos`
* Collect all the C/C++/ASM compiling and link options

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_rules:

Makefile.rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.rules** file will do the following things:

* Collect all the sources during compiling
* Define all the rules used for building, uploading and debugging
* Print help message for build system


.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_files:

Makefile.files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.files** file will do the following things:

* Define common C/C++/ASM source and include directories
* Define common C/C++/ASM macros

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_soc:

Makefile.soc
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.soc** will include valid makefiles located in
**<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/SoC/<SOC>/build.mk** according to
the :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_soc` makefile variable setting.

It will define the following items:

* **DOWNLOAD** and **CORE** variables

  - For :ref:`design_soc_demosoc`, we can support all the modes defined in
    :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_download`, and **CORE** list defined in
    :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_core`
  - For :ref:`design_soc_gd32vf103`, The **CORE** is fixed to N205, since
    it is a real SoC chip, and only **FlashXIP** download mode is supported

* Linker script used according to the **DOWNLOAD** mode settings
* OpenOCD debug configuration file used for the SoC and Board
* Some extra compiling or debugging options

A valid SoC should be organized like this, take ``demosoc`` as example:

.. code-block::

    SoC/demosoc
    ├── Board
    │   └── nuclei_fpga_eval
    │       ├── Include
    │       │   ├── board_nuclei_fpga_eval.h
    │       │   └── nuclei_sdk_hal.h
    │       ├── Source
    │       │   └── GCC
    │       └── openocd_demosoc.cfg
    ├── build.mk
    └── Common
        ├── Include
        │   ├── demosoc.h
        │   ├── ... ...
        │   ├── demosoc_uart.h
        │   ├── nuclei_sdk_soc.h
        │   └── system_demosoc.h
        └── Source
            ├── Drivers
            │   ├── ... ...
            │   └── demosoc_uart.c
            ├── GCC
            │   ├── intexc_demosoc.S
            │   └── startup_demosoc.S
            ├── Stubs
            │   ├── read.c
            │   ├── ... ...
            │   └── write.c
            ├── demosoc_common.c
            └── system_demosoc.c


.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_rtos:

Makefile.rtos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.rtos** will include **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/OS/<RTOS>/build.mk**
according to our :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_rtos` variable.

A valid rtos should be organized like this, take ``UCOSII`` as example:

.. code-block::

    OS/UCOSII/
    ├── arch
    ├── build.mk
    ├── license.txt
    ├── readme.md
    └── source


If no :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_rtos` is chosen, then RTOS
code will not be included during compiling, user will develop
baremetal application.

If **FreeRTOS**, **UCOSII** or **RTThread** RTOS is chosen, then FreeRTOS
UCOSII, or RTThread source code will be included during compiling, and extra
compiler option ``-DRTOS_$(RTOS_UPPER)`` will be passed, then user can develop RTOS application.

For example, if ``FreeRTOS`` is selected, then ``-DRTOS_FREERTOS`` compiler option
will be passed.

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_components:

Makefile.components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.components** will include ``build.mk`` Makefiles of selected components defined
via makefile variable :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_middleware`, the Makefiles are placed in
the sub-folders of **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Components/**.

A valid middleware component should be organized like this, take ``fatfs`` as example :

.. code-block::

    Components/fatfs/
    ├── build.mk
    ├── documents
    ├── LICENSE.txt
    └── source


For example, if there are two valid middleware components in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Components/**, called
``fatfs`` and ``tjpgd``, and you want to use them in your application, then you can set ``MIDDLEWARE``
like this ``MIDDLEWARE := fatfs tjpgd``, then the application will include these two middlewares into
build process.

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_core:

Makefile.core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.core** is used to define the RISC-V ARCH and ABI used during
compiling of the CORE list supported.

If you want to add a new **CORE**, you need to add a new line before **SUPPORTED_CORES**,
and append the new **CORE** to **SUPPORTED_CORES**.

For example, if you want to add a new **CORE** called **n308**, and the **n308**'s
**ARCH** and **ABI** are ``rv32imafdc`` and ``ilp32d``, then you can add a new line
like this ``N308_CORE_ARCH_ABI = rv32imafdc ilp32d``, and append **n308** to **SUPPORTED_CORES**
like this ``SUPPORTED_CORES = n201 n201e n203 n203e n205 n205e n305 n307 n307fd n308 nx600``

.. note::

   * The appended new **CORE** need to lower-case, e.g. *n308*
   * The new defined variable **N308_CORE_ARCH_ABI** need to be all upper-case.


.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_global:

Makefile.global
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This **Makefile.global** file is an optional file, and will not be tracked by git,
user can create own **Makefile.global** in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Build** directory.

In this file, user can define custom **SOC**, **BOARD**, **DOWNLOAD** options to
overwrite the default configuration.

For example, if you will use only the :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar`, you can
create the **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/Build/Makefile.global** as below:

.. code-block:: Makefile

    SOC ?= gd32vf103
    BOARD ?= gd32vf103v_rvstar
    DOWNLOAD ?= flashxip

.. note::

    * If you add above file, then you can build, run, debug application without passing
      **SOC**, **BOARD** and **DOWNLOAD** variables using make command for
      :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar` board, e.g.

      - Build and run application for :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar`: ``make run``
      - Debug application for :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar`: ``make debug``

    * The :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar` only support ``FlashXIP`` download mode.
    * If you create the **Makefile.global** like above sample code, you will also be able
      to use Nuclei SDK build system as usually, it will only change the default **SOC**,
      **BOARD** and **DOWNLOAD**, but you can still override the default variable using
      make command, such as ``make SOC=demosoc BOARD=nuclei_fpga_eval DOWNLOAD=ilm``

.. _develop_buildsystem_makefile_local:

Makefile.local
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the :ref:`develop_buildsystem_makefile_global` is used to override the default Makefile
configurations, and the **Makefile.local** is used to override application level Makefile
configurations, and also this file will not be tracked by git.

User can create ``Makefile.local`` file in any of the application folder, placed together with
the application Makefile, for example, you can create ``Makefile.local`` in ``application/baremetal/helloworld``
to override default make configuration for this **helloworld** application.

If you want to change the default board for **helloworld** to use :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar`,
you can create ``application/baremetal/helloworld/Makefile.local`` as below:

.. code-block:: Makefile

    SOC ?= gd32vf103
    BOARD ?= gd32vf103v_rvstar
    DOWNLOAD ?= flashxip

.. note::

    * This local make configuration will override global and default make configuration.
    * If you just want to change only some applications' makefile configuration, you can
      add and update ``Makefile.local`` for those applications.


.. _develop_buildsystem_make_targets:

Makefile targets of make command
--------------------------------

Here is a list of the :ref:`table_dev_buildsystem_4`.

.. _table_dev_buildsystem_4:

.. list-table:: Make targets supported by Nuclei SDK Build System
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - target

.. note::

   * The selected configuration is controlled by
     :ref:`develop_buildsystem_exposed_make_vars`
   * For ``run_openocd`` and ``run_gdb`` target, if you want to
     change a new gdb port, you can pass the variable
     :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_gdb_port`


.. _develop_buildsystem_exposed_make_vars:

Makefile variables passed by make command
-----------------------------------------

In Nuclei SDK build system, we exposed the following Makefile variables
which can be passed via make command.

* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_soc`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_board`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_download`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_core`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_simulation`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_gdb_port`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_v`
* :ref:`develop_buildsystem_var_silent`

.. note::

   * These variables can also be used and defined in application Makefile
   * If you just want to fix your running board of your application, you can
     just define these variables in application Makefile, if defined, then
     you can simply use ``make clean``, ``make upload`` or ``make debug``, etc.


.. _develop_buildsystem_var_soc:

SOC
~~~

**SOC** variable is used to declare which SoC is used in application during compiling.

You can easily find the supported SoCs in the **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/SoC** directory.

Currently we support the following SoCs, see :ref:`table_dev_buildsystem_1`.

.. _table_dev_buildsystem_1:

.. list-table:: Supported SoCs
   :widths: 10, 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - **SOC**
     - Reference
   * - gd32vf103
     - :ref:`design_soc_gd32vf103`
   * - demosoc
     - :ref:`design_soc_demosoc`

.. note::

   If you are our SoC subsystem customer, in the SDK delivered to you, you can find your soc name
   in this **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/SoC** directory, take ``gd32vf103`` SoC as example, when **SOC=gd32vf103``,
   the SoC source code in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/SoC/gd32vf103/Common** will be used.

   This documentation just document the open source version of Nuclei SDK's supported SOC and Board.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_board:

BOARD
~~~~~

**BOARD** variable is used to declare which Board is used in application during compiling.

The **BOARD** variable should match the supported boards of chosen **SOC**.
You can easily find the supported Boards in the **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/<SOC>/Board/** directory.

* :ref:`table_dev_buildsystem_2`
* :ref:`table_dev_buildsystem_3`


Currently we support the following SoCs.

.. _table_dev_buildsystem_2:

.. list-table:: Supported Boards when SOC=gd32vf103
   :widths: 20, 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - **BOARD**
     - Reference
   * - gd32vf103v_rvstar
     - :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_rvstar`
   * - gd32vf103v_eval
     - :ref:`design_board_gd32vf103v_eval`
   * - gd32vf103c_longan_nano
     - :ref:`design_board_sipeed_longan_nano`
   * - gd32vf103c_t_display
     - :ref:`design_board_sipeed_longan_nano`

.. _table_dev_buildsystem_3:

.. list-table:: Supported Boards when SOC=demosoc
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - **BOARD**
     - Reference
   * - nuclei_fpga_eval
     - :ref:`design_board_nuclei_fpga_eval`

.. note::

    * If you only specify **SOC** variable in make command, it will use default **BOARD**
      and **CORE** option defined in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/SoC/<SOC>/build.mk**
    * If you are our SoC subsystem customer, in the SDK delivered to you, you can check
      the board supported list in **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/<SOC>/Board/**, take ``SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar``
      as example, the board source code located **<NUCLEI_SDK_ROOT>/gd32vf103/Board/gd32vf103v_rvstar** will be used.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_download:

DOWNLOAD
~~~~~~~~

**DOWNLOAD** variable is used to declare the download mode of the application,
currently it has these modes supported as described in table
:ref:`table_dev_buildsystem_5`

.. _table_dev_buildsystem_5:

.. list-table:: Supported download modes
   :widths: 10 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center

   * - **DOWNLOAD**
     - Description
   * - ilm
     - | Program will be download into ilm/ram and
       | run directly in ilm/ram, program will lost when poweroff
   * - flash
     - | Program will be download into flash, when running,
       | program will be copied to ilm/ram and run in ilm/ram
   * - flashxip
     - Program will to be download into flash and run directly in flash
   * - ddr
     - | Program will to be download into ddr and
       | run directly in ddr, program will lost when poweroff

.. note::

    * :ref:`design_soc_gd32vf103` only support **DOWNLOAD=flashxip**
    * :ref:`design_soc_demosoc` support all the download modes.
    * **flashxip** mode in :ref:`design_soc_demosoc` is very slow due to
      the CORE frequency is very slow, and flash execution speed is slow
    * **ddr** mode is introduced in release ``0.2.5`` of Nuclei SDK
    * macro ``DOWNLOAD_MODE`` and ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` will be defined in Makefile,
      eg. when ``DOWNLOAD=flash``, macro will be defined as ``-DDOWNLOAD_MODE=DOWNLOAD_MODE_FLASH``,
      and ``-DDOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING=\"flash\"``, the ``flash`` will be in upper case,
      currently ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` macro is used in ``system_<Device>.c`` when
      banner is print.
    * This download mode is also used to clarify whether in the link script,
      your eclic vector table is placed in ``.vtable_ilm`` or ``.vtable`` section, eg.
      for demosoc, when ``DOWNLOAD=flash``, vector table is placed in ``.vtable_ilm`` section,
      and an extra macro called ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` will be passed in Makefile.
      When ``VECTOR_TABLE_REMAPPED`` is defined, it means vector table's LMA and VMA are
      different, it is remapped.
    * From release ``0.3.2``, this ``DOWNLOAD_MODE`` should not be used, and macros
      ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_ILM``, ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_FLASH``, ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_FLASHXIP`` and
      ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_DDR`` previously defined in ``riscv_encoding.h`` now are moved to
      ``<Device.h>`` such as ``demosoc.h``, and should be deprecated in future.
      Now we are directly using ``DOWNLOAD_MODE_STRING`` to pass the download mode string,
      no longer need to define it in source code as before.
    * From release ``0.3.2``, you can define **DOWNLOAD** not just the download mode list above,
      you can use other download mode names specified by your customized SoC.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_core:

CORE
~~~~

**CORE** variable is used to declare the Nuclei processor core
of the application.

Currently it has these cores supported as described in table
:ref:`table_dev_buildsystem_6`.

.. _table_dev_buildsystem_6:

.. table:: Supported Nuclei Processor cores
   :widths: 20 20 20
   :align: center

   ========  ========== =======
   **CORE**  **ARCH**   **ABI**
   n201      rv32iac    ilp32

   ux600f    rv64imafc  lp64f
   ux600fd   rv64imafdc lp64d
   ========  ========== =======

When **CORE** is selected, the **ARCH** and **ABI** are set, and it will affect the
compiler options, eg. If **CORE=n205**, then ``ARCH=rv32imac, ABI=ilp32``,
riscv arch related compile and link options will be passed, for this case,
it will be ``-march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -mcmodel=medany``.

The some SoCs, the CORE is fixed, so the ARCH and ABI will be fixed, such as
``gd32vf103`` SoC, in build system, the CORE is fixed to n205, and ARCH=rv32imac, ABI=ilp32.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_simulation:

SIMULATION
~~~~~~~~~~

If **SIMULATION=1**, it means the program is optimized for hardware simulation environment.

Currently if **SIMULATION=1**, it will pass compile option **-DCFG_SIMULATION**,
application can use this **CFG_SIMULATION** to optimize program for hardware
simulation environment.

.. note::

   * Currently the benchmark applications in **application/baremetal/benchmark** used this optimization

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_gdb_port:

GDB_PORT
~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    * This new variable **GDB_PORT** is added in Nuclei SDK since version ``0.2.4``

This variable is not used usually, by default the **GDB_PORT** variable is ``3333``.

If you want to change a debug gdb port for openocd and gdb when run ``run_openocd`` and
``run_gdb`` target, you can pass a new port such as ``3344`` to this variable.

For example, if you want to debug application using run_openocd and
run_gdb and specify a different port other than ``3333``.

You can do it like this, take ``nuclei_fpga_eval`` board for example, such as port ``3344``:

* Open openocd server: ``make SOC=demosoc BOARD=nuclei_fpga_eval CORE=n307 GDB_PORT=3344 run_openocd``

* connect gdb with openocd server: ``make SOC=demosoc BOARD=nuclei_fpga_eval CORE=n307 GDB_PORT=3344 run_gdb``

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_banner:

BANNER
~~~~~~

If **BANNER=0**, when program is rebuilt, then the banner message print in console will not be print,
banner print is default enabled via ``NUCLEI_BANNER=1`` in ``nuclei_sdk_hal.h``.

when ``BANNER=0``, an macro ``-DNUCLEI_BANNER=0`` will be passed in Makefile.

The banner message looks like this:

.. code-block:: c

    Nuclei SDK Build Time: Jul 23 2021, 10:22:50
    Download Mode: ILM
    CPU Frequency 15999959 Hz


.. _develop_buildsystem_var_v:

V
~

If **V=1**, it will display compiling message in verbose including compiling options.

By default, no compiling options will be displayed in make console message just to print
less message and make the console message cleaner. If you want to see what compiling option
is used, please pass **V=1** in your make command.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_silent:

SILENT
~~~~~~

If **SILENT=1**, it will not display any compiling messsage.

If you don't want to see any compiling message, you can pass **SILENT=1** in your make command.

.. _develop_buildsystem_app_make_vars:

Makefile variables used only in Application Makefile
----------------------------------------------------

The following variables should be used in application Makefile at your demand,
e.g. ``application/baremetal/demo_timer/Makefile``.

.. note::

    * About Newlib and Newlib nano difference, please check
      https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-newlib/blob/riscv-newlib-3.2.0/newlib/README
    * About Nuclei C runtime library, it didn't provided all the features that
      newlib can do, it is highly optimized for deeply embedded scenery
    * Nuclei C runtime library is only available in Nuclei GNU Toolchain released after Nov 2021.
    * Since there are different c runtime library can be chosen now, so developer
      need to provide different stub functions for different library, please check
      ``SoC/demosoc/Common/Source/Stubs/`` and ``SoC/demosoc/build.mk`` for example.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_archext:

* **ARCH_EXT=pv**: RISC-V packed simd and vector extension.
* **ARCH_EXT=bpv**: RISC-V bitmanipulation, packed simd and vector extension.

It is suggested to use this ARCH_EXT with other arch options like this, can be found in
``SoC/demosoc/build.mk``:


.. code-block:: makefile

    # Set RISCV_ARCH and RISCV_ABI
    CORE_UPPER := $(call uc, $(CORE))
    CORE_ARCH_ABI := $($(CORE_UPPER)_CORE_ARCH_ABI)

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_nogc:

NOGC
~~~~

**NOGC** variable is used to control whether to enable gc sections to reduce program
code size or not, by default GC is enabled to reduce code size.

When GC is enabled, these options will be added:

* Adding to compiler options: ``-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections``
* Adding to linker options: ``-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--check-sections``

If you want to enable this GC feature, you can set **NOGC=0** (default), GC feature will
remove sections for you, but sometimes it might remove sections that are useful,
e.g. For Nuclei SDK test cases, we use ctest framework, and we need to set **NOGC=1**
to disable GC feature.

When ``NOGC=0``(default), extra compile options ``-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections``,
and extra link options ``-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--check-sections`` will be passed.

.. _develop_buildsystem_var_rtthread_msh:

RTTHREAD_MSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When **RTTHREAD_MSH** is set to **1**:

* The RTThread MSH component source code will be included
* The MSH thread will be enabled in the background
* Currently the msh getchar implementation is using a weak function implemented
  in ``rt_hw_console_getchar`` in ``OS/RTTThread/libcpu/risc-v/nuclei/cpuport.c``
